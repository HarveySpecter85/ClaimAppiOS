## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Corrective Actions Workflow
**Files**: `apps/web/src/app/api/corrective-actions/route.js`, `apps/web/src/app/api/corrective-actions/[id]/route.js`

- [ ] Verify creation linked to incident_id

- [ ] Document status values: open, overdue, completed
- [ ] Document: no auto-closure of incident when all actions complete

### Task 2: Audit Review/Approval Workflow

- [ ] Document reviewed_by, reviewed_at tracking
- [ ] Document dossier compilation (what's included)
- [ ] Note: no final closure step after approval

### Task 3: Document Resolution/Closure Gaps
