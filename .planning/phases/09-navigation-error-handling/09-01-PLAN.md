# Plan 09-01: Audit Web Navigation

## Objective
Verify all web routes, links, and navigation work correctly

## Scope
Audit only - Document all gaps, defer fixes to Phase 10

---

## Files to Read

- `apps/web/src/app/` - all route files
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` or similar navigation component
- `apps/web/src/components/Header.jsx` or similar
- Dashboard components with internal links

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Sidebar Navigation Links

**Actions:**
1. Find the sidebar/navigation component
2. List all navigation links defined
3. For each link, verify the target route exists in `apps/web/src/app/`
4. Document any missing pages (e.g., `/incidents` page)

**Expected findings:**
- Missing `/incidents` page (sidebar links to non-existent route)

---

### Task 2: Audit Route Structure

**Actions:**
1. List all page files in `apps/web/src/app/`
2. Create a route map showing all available routes
3. Identify dynamic routes ([id] patterns)
4. Check for orphan routes (pages with no navigation to them)

**Expected output:**
- Complete route map
- List of dynamic routes
- Any orphan routes identified

---

### Task 3: Audit Internal Page Links

**Actions:**
1. Check dashboard components for internal links
2. Look for breadcrumb navigation
3. Search for Link components and href attributes
4. Verify all internal links point to valid routes

**Expected findings:**
- Broken internal links
- Missing breadcrumbs

---

### Task 4: Document Navigation Gaps

**Actions:**
1. Compile all missing pages
2. List dead-end routes (pages with no exit navigation)
3. Create recommendations for Phase 10

**Deliverables:**
- Gap analysis table
- Priority recommendations
