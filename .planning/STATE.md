### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Defer payment integration (Stripe/RevenueCat) to post-launch
- Comprehensive planning depth selected
- YOLO mode enabled for auto-execution
- Parallel execution enabled

### Deferred Issues

- Login page (`apps/web/src/app/login/page.jsx`) still contains backdoor credentials as placeholder text in UI — cosmetic issue, API backdoor removed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Critical security issues RESOLVED in Phase 1:**
- ~~Hardcoded admin backdoor in `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/login/route.js`~~ — REMOVED
- ~~10+ API routes missing `requireRole()` authentication~~ — ALL SECURED

**Phase 1 Security Audit Results:**
- 50/56 API routes now secured with `requireRole()`
- 6 auth endpoints intentionally unauthenticated (login, logout, me, register, forgot-password, reset-password)
- 2 token-based endpoints for external form submission (secure-form-links/verify, resolve)
